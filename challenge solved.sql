-- 1. Display all available tables in the Sakila database.
USE sakila;
SHOW TABLES;
-- ===============================================================================================================
-- 2. Retrieve all the data from the tables `actor`, `film` and `customer`.
SELECT * FROM actor;
SELECT * FROM film; -- original_language_id is null?
SELECT * FROM customer;
-- ===============================================================================================================
-- 3. Retrieve the following columns from their respective tables:
--
-- 3.1 Titles of all films from the `film` table
SELECT title FROM film;
--
-- 3.2 List of languages used in films, with the column aliased as `language` from the `language` table
SELECT language_id AS language FROM film;
--
-- 3.3 List of first names of all employees from the `staff` table
SELECT first_name AS first_name FROM staff;

-- ===============================================================================================================
-- 4. Retrieve unique release years.
SELECT DISTINCT release_year FROM film; -- same as python df[column].unique()
-- ===============================================================================================================
-- 5. Counting records for database insights:  COUNT
--
-- 5.1 Determine the number of stores that the company has.
SELECT * FROM store;
SELECT COUNT(store_id) AS nbr_stores FROM store;
--
-- 5.2 Determine the number of employees that the company has.
SELECT * FROM staff;
SELECT COUNT(staff_id) AS nbr_employees FROM staff;
--
-- 5.3 Determine how many films are available for rent and how many have been rented.
SELECT * FROM film;
DESCRIBE film;

-- struggled a bit with this one
--
-- Number of all films
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nbr_films_all FROM film;
SELECT * FROM film;
--
-- Number of films available for rent
SELECT * FROM inventory;
SELECT DISTINCT film_id FROM inventory;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT film_id) AS nbr_films_available_for_rent FROM inventory;
--
-- Number of films that have been rented
SELECT * FROM rental;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT rental_id) AS number_of_films_rented
FROM rental;

--
-- 5.4 Determine the number of distinct last names of the actors in the database.
SELECT DISTINCT last_name AS actors_last_name FROM actor;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS nbr_actors_last_name FROM actor; -- i mixed up the distinct before count
-- ===============================================================================================================
-- 6. Retrieve the 10 longest films.
-- method 1 : ORDER BY / DESC LIMIT 10
SELECT * FROM film ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 10;
-- method 2 : WHERE column = (SELECT MAX(column)FROM table_name)
SELECT * FROM film WHERE length = (SELECT MAX(length) FROM film);
-- ===============================================================================================================
-- 7.  Use filtering techniques in order to:
--
-- 7.1 Retrieve all actors with the first name "SCARLETT".
SELECT * FROM actor;
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE first_name = 'SCARLETT';
--
-- 7.2 Retrieve all movies that have ARMAGEDDON in their title and have a duration longer than 100 minutes. 
-- **Hint: use `LIKE` operator. [More information here.](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp)**
SELECT * FROM film WHERE title LIKE 'ARMAGEDDON'; -- false gotta use regex
SELECT * FROM film WHERE title LIKE '%ARMAGEDDON%';
SELECT * FROM film WHERE title LIKE '%ARMAGEDDON%' AND length > 100;
--
-- 7.3 Determine the number of films that include Behind the Scenes content
SELECT * FROM film;
SELECT * FROM film WHERE special_features LIKE '%Behind the Scenes%';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film WHERE special_features LIKE '%Behind the Scenes%';
SELECT COUNT(*) AS films_behind_the_scenes FROM film WHERE special_features LIKE '%Behind the Scenes%';
-- ===============================================================================================================
